        <h2> Cane Corsa </h2>

        <p>
            Corsos are typical mastiffs in every sense: large and impressive, intelligent and affectionate, and intensely loyal to their people. Standing at approximately 27 inches tall and weighing between 80 and 120 pounds, with a large, square head and deep chest,
            adult corsos have an imposing stature.The Cane Corso is a large dog of molossoid type, and is closely related to the Neapolitan Mastiff. It is well muscled[7] and less bulky than most other mastiff breeds. According to the international standard,
            dogs should stand some 62–70 cm at the withers and weigh 45–50 kg; females are about 4 cm smaller, and weigh some 5 kg less. The head is large, slightly over one third of the height at the withers in length, with a well-defined stop. The top
            of the cranium is flat and slightly convergent to the muzzle. The eyes are oval in shape, and set well apart. The iris of the eye should be as dark as possible.[2] The coat is short, dense and lustrous. It may be black, various shades of grey
            (lead-grey, light grey or slate-grey) or fawn (dark fawn, light fawn, or stag red), or dark wheaten ('fromentino'); it may be brindled. Minor white markings on the chest, the feet or the nose are tolerated

        <h2> The King:Lion</h2>
        <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger
            than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.
            The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.
